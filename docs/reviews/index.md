These are my rough notes on media that I've reviewed. This will include things such as books, youtube vides, web articles, etc.

The original notes are usually gathered inline (e.g. Kindle notes) but almost all go through Readwise, so I can review them on a regular cadence. I then make the notes you find here. This will ensure I only add my outlook and not accidently share more then I intend.
