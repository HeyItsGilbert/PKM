# Hey... It's Gilbert

Hi all, welcome to my [[DigitalGarden]]. I've been taking a lot of notes in [[Obsidian]] and I came across some Digital Garden's. I love the idea of learning in Public, so I decided to give it a go.

I'm going to document how I built this site with [[Obsidian]], [[PowerShell]] and [[Hugo]].
