# Hey... It's Gilbert

Hi all, welcome to my [DigitalGarden](./DigitalGarden.md). I've been taking a lot of notes in [Obsidian](./Obsidian.md) and I came across some Digital Garden's. I love the idea of learning in Public, so I decided to give it a go.

I'm going to document how I built this site with [Obsidian](./Obsidian.md), [PowerShell](./PowerShell.md) and [Hugo](./Hugo.md).
