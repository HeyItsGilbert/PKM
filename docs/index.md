# Notes

Hi all, welcome to my [DigitalGarden](./Atomics/DigitalGarden.md). I've been taking a lot of notes in [Obsidian](./Atomics/Obsidian.md) and I came across some Digital Garden's. I love the idea of learning in Public, so I decided to give it a go.

I'm going to document how I built this site with [Obsidian](./Atomics/Obsidian.md), [PowerShell](./Atomics/PowerShell.md) and [Hugo](./Atomics/Hugo.md).

Also [Test](./Test.md) which is top level.
