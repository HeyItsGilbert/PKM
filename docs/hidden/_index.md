# Hey... It's Gilbert

Hi all, welcome to my [[./DigitalGarden|DigitalGarden]]. I've been taking a lot of notes in [[./Obsidian|Obsidian]] and I came across some Digital Garden's. I love the idea of learning in Public, so I decided to give it a go.

I'm going to document how I built this site with [[./Obsidian|Obsidian]], [[./PowerShell|PowerShell]] and [[./Hugo|Hugo]].

I use a script to generate the Hugo files.
